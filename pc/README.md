# Parser Combinator

Notes/Code exploring writing a useful set of parser combinators in Rust.

## TODO:
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] (maybe) Instead of using bare callbacks, switch to a trait based system,
      which should also allow easier composition of the combinators.

## Resources used:

- [F# for Fun and Profit series on Parser
Combinators](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/)
as guidance.
