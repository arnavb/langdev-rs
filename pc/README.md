# Parser Combinator

Notes/Code exploring writing a useful set of parser combinators in Rust.

## TODO:
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] (maybe) Instead of using bare callbacks, switch to a trait based system,
      which should also allow easier composition of the combinators.

## Resources used:

Combinators](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/)
as guidance.

   closures](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/unable-to-reduce-over-collection-of-closures/136349/3)
